# UltraCinema
This is a my personal Java project.
This is a ticket office management system for a Cinema.
The User Clients can register into it and the Admind can access with a special username and password for make changes to the system like add films or modify screening times.

## Technologies used for the project:
- Java 8
- JavaFX API version 15.0.1
- SQLite Database
- FXML files

In this project I used 3 Design Pattern of the GoF:
- Command Pattern: due to managment of the main command of the Admins and the Users.
- Strategy: due to the differnet payment Strategy
- Singleton: used for the single instance of the database and the command Manager
